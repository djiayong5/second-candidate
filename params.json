Tested on Mac OS X 10.9 and Ubuntu 14.04.\r\n* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) 2.8 or newer. For UNIX users, check your CMake version in terminal by `cmake -version`.\r\n* An GNU C++ Compiler or LLVM compiler that support C++ 11 and OpenMP.\r\n\r\n#### Build\r\n\r\nWe use CMake as the build system. On terminal,\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:your/repo.git pq-learn\r\n$ cd ./pq-learn\r\n$ git submodule update --init\r\n$ cmake -H. -Bbuild && cmake --build build -- -j4\r\n# OR IF YOU WANT TO BUILD TESTS\r\n$ cmake -DBUILD_TEST=ON -H. -Bbuild && cmake --build build -- -j4\r\n```\r\nThis script will create binaries in your `bin/` and `lib/` directories. \r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nWe are using Doxygen to generate the documentation. You can find that the style of comments for every methods that are implemented in these source codes are matching with Doxygen style.\r\nTo generate the documentation:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cd ./doc\r\n$ doxygen config.doxygen\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoxygen will create the documentation files in HTML and LaTeX format. You can also find samples and documentation in the Wiki of this project.\r\n\r\n## To developers\r\n\r\n* This project was built under Eclipse CDT so we leave the configuration files `.cproject` and `.project` of the project here. If you are using Eclipse, just import the folder that contains the source code.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
